## **1. mRNA Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) & Sample Tag Library Preparation Protocol**

**1.1 Introduction:**<img src="images/media/image31.png" style="width:5.16667in;height:4.88563in" />

**Figure 2:** Showing workflow of mRNA Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) & Sample Tag Library Preparation

After single-cell capture on the BD Rhapsody Single Cell Analysis System or the BD Rhapsody Express single-cell analysis system, we create single-cell whole transcriptome mRNA and sample tag libraries for sequencing. In the enhancement cell, the Capturer bead cDNA from mRNA is already encoded, and at the same time, barcode information is also added to the sample tag during reverse transcription, which enables amplification of the sample tag solution.

In preparation for sample tag sequencing libraries, first we denature the extended sample tag from BD Rhapsody Enhancement Cell Capture beads, and later it is amplified through a series of PCR steps. While using a random priming approach, the whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) library is prepared directly from BD Rhapsody Enhancement Cell Capture beads, followed by index PCR. Both the whole transcriptome mRNA and the Sample Tag libraries can be combined for sequencing.

**1.2 Time consideration**

**1.3 Performing random priming and extension (RPE) on BD Rhapsody Enhanced Cell Capture Beads with cDNA:**

This section outlines the procedure for generating random priming products. Initially, sample tags containing barcode sequences are released from the BD Rhapsody™ Enhanced Cell Capture Beads by denaturation and retained for subsequent sample tag amplification. Random primers are then annealed to the bead-bound cDNA and extended using an enzymatic reaction. To enhance assay sensitivity, the primer hybridization and extension steps are performed twice.

In this protocol, initial cell inputs should be between 1000 to 20000 single cells for whole transcription amplification library preparation.

9.  Keeping the tubes on the magnet, use a small-volume Pipet to remove any residual supernatant from the tube.

10. Air-dry the beads at RT for 5 minutes or until the beads no longer look glossy.

11. Remove the tube from the magnet and pipet 40 μL of the elution buffer into the tube. Pipet-mix the suspension at least 10 times until beads are fully suspended.

**1.9 Performing WTA Index PCR**

This section describes how to generate mRNA libraries compatible with the Illumina sequencing platform by adding full-length Illumina sequencing adapters and indices through PCR. For cell capture samples from multiple cartridges, the same reverse primer can be used to label all the library types from one cartridge (for example, WTA and SMK from cartridge 1 can both be given reverse primer 1, while WTA and SMK from cartridge 2 can be labelled with reverse primer 2, and so on). The kit provides ***4 indexing primers*** and can label all sample combinations from up to 4 cartridges for the same sequencing run.

**Dilute the RPE PCR products with Elution Buffer such that the concentration of the 150–600 bp peak is 2 nM. If the product concentration is \<2 nM, do not dilute and continue.**

For example, if the Tapestation measurement of the 150–600 bp peak is 6 nM, then dilute the sample threefold with Elution Buffer to 2 nM.

**1.14 Purifying Sample Tag index PCR products**

This section describes how to perform a single-sided AMPure cleanup to remove primer dimers from the Sample Tag Index PCR products. The final product is purified double-stranded DNA with full-length Illumina adapter sequences.

**NOTE:** Perform the purification in the post-amplification workspace.

1.  In 50.0 μL of the Sample Tag Index PCR products, add 40 μL of AMPure beads (RT).

2.  Pipet-mix 10 times, and incubate at RT for 5 minutes.

3.  Place the tube on the strip tube magnet for 3 minutes. Remove the supernatant.

4.  Keeping the tube on the magnet, gently add 200 μL of fresh 80% ethyl alcohol into the tube, and incubate for 30 seconds. Remove the supernatant. Repeat this step for a total of two washes.

5.  Keeping the tube on the magnet, use a small-volume Pipet to remove and discard the residual supernatant from the tube.

6.  Air-dry the beads at RT for 3 minutes.

7.  Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the pellet in 30 μL of elution buffer. Pipet-mix until the beads are fully resuspended.

8.  Incubate at RT for 2 minutes, and briefly centrifuge.

9.  Place the tube on the magnet until the solution is clear, usually 30 seconds.

10. Pipet the entire eluate (~30 μL) into new 1.5 mL LoBind® tubes (final sequencing libraries).

> **STOPPING POINT**. Store at -25°C to -15°C for up to 6 months until sequencing.

11. Estimate the concentration by quantifying 2 μL of the final sequencing library with a Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit to obtain an approximate concentration of PCR products to dilute for quantification on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation system using the Agilent High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape Assay. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. The expected concentration of the libraries is \>1.5 ng/μL.

The sample tag library should show a peak of ~270 bp. (tape station profile seen in fig.)

## **2. Sequencing Recommendations:**

- For the NextSeq2000 High Output run, load the flow cell at a concentration between 650 pM with 3% PhiX for a sequencing run.

- Sequence 30,000 reads per cell for WTA moderate sequencing and 600 reads/cell for SMK.

- Select a flow cell after calculating the expected output. (Depends on final cell number captured in cartridge)
